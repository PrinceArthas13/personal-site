      <h3>Design & Development</h3>
      <p class="">I've always had a love and obsession with technology starting since I was 8 years old. Over the years I've always consumed the use of tech but never really dove head first into the
      actual learning part. Now I'm learning anything and everything and I've been obsessed always wanting to know more. Web applications is my starting point and eventually want to dive into
      robotics, and VR design. </p>

      <h3>3D-Printing</h3>
      <p class="">A great skill to have and one that I love doing is 3D printing the designs of what you can make are endless and fun to tinker around with.</p>
